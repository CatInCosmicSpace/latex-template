# IU8 package

This package consist of class file and style files for writing 
reports at the IU8 department of IU faculty of BMSTU 
(Bauman Moscow State Technical University).

This class defines all headings, structure elements and other things
in respect of russian standard GOST 7.32-2017. But there are 
correctives to be compatible with our local IU8 department
requirements.

This package was made by a student for use by other students 
interested in LaTeX.

Please do not use this package if you are not a student of our department.
